        <!--Questions:

        CSS
        1) Make 'mainDiv', 'innerDiv' take whole screen available(Note: do not remove padding on these components).
        2) write css for 'leftDiv', 'rightDiv" to take 50% of width and parent height.
        3) Optimize CSS.

       HTML
        4) Optimization of Html page.

       JS: /*Dynamically add two buttons on page load and these buttons should call getImage1Data and getImage2Data in the JS file. Please don't use any libraries.*/
       5) Optimize javascript code.
       6) Write Sample code for dynamically creating image tag for first image to the div.
       7) Add background to right div with src from 2nd request to cover parent background.


    Suppose you have a parent Div with multiple Buttons in it.
      Look for sample code in sample.js file
      8) Can you optimize the event listeners part of code ?
